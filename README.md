This is a remix of a tutorial found on Tom's Hardware. I have added a few fun things:
-A status for when you're hacking the mainframe with a looping "..." animation.
-A status for bein' sleepy. Sometimes you just gotta let the people know. 
-A custom submission box for when the other buttons aren't quite specific enough.

Enjoy! And make sure to check out the full tutorial!
